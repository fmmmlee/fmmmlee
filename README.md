Hi, I'm Matthew. I'm a 22-year-old software developer and recent MSc graduate who enjoys building things, usually with code.

My most popular repos: 

- [GW2 Addon Manager](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/GW2-Addon-Manager)
- [D2Solo](https://github.com/fmmmlee/D2Solo)

If I'm not working (currently at Epic, working on their data exchange platform), you can typically find me either enamored with a shiny new thing for my development toolset, poring over the details of a software project, or writing about various human-adjacent topics. If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me [via email](mailto:fmmmlee@gmail.com).

Curious about the logo? It's just part of my name ‚Äî last name Êùé, middle name ‰ºüÊòé ‚Äî with all the characters overlaid on top of one another.
